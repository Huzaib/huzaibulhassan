        • Enhanced night videos using SRGANs based super-resolution technique combining content and adversarial losses

        • Generated the training data artificially due to constraints of day-night video data collection

        • Combined techniques including Depthwise ConvNets, involutions, and distillation to reduce the memory footprint

        • Trained a conditional generative adversarial network on MNIST dataset for artificial digit generation

        • Tuned the hyperparameters in order to get indistinguishable images and avoid mode collapse

        • Conditioned the generated images on the basis of labels of the particular numbers and delivered a workshop
